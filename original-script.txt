Use 3 Keys to Problem Solving to brainstorm with the prospective student.

The library is an option to get started before getting your own computer. Most libraries won't allow you to download software, so it's not a good permanent solution.

Some students use a friend or family member's computer as well.

Do any of these options work for you?

If the prospective student's SAP status reflects FA probation or FA dismissal ▼

Were you aware that you left the University on a FA (probation or dismissal) status?

Let me explain what this means. In order to remain in school and be eligible for federal student aid, you must maintain satisfactory academic progress, or "SAP".

When you withdrew from the University, were you aware what your CGPA was at that time?

This CGPA was the reason why you were placed on Academic Probation, so the next step is to apply for reinstatement to the University through our appeal process. You will need to complete a formal, written letter and submit this to our Appeals Board for review.

If applicable, click here to explain Rate of Progress​

I can provide guidance on what to include in your letter. In it you will let the appeals board know what circumstances led to your academic performance. They will need a detailed explanation of the unforeseen and/or serious in nature barriers or problems that caused the lack of academic success. You should also include as many details as possible about your situation at the time of the decrease in academic performance.

I'm going to send you an email with instructions on how the appeal process works and also a template you will use for your appeal letter. The subject is "Appeal Directions Student ID#"

Are you able to access your email to verify you received it?

If yes, review the email with the prospective student. Otherwise, have the student take notes as you explain the steps.

The first half of the email gives some general directions as well as answers to frequently asked questions about how the appeal process works.

The second half of the email has a template with five questions listed. Let's review those so you have a better idea of what the Appeals Board is looking for from you in your letter.

Question 1 is your state of residence.

Question 2 is asking if you will return to the same program.

Question 3 is asking for a detailed explanation of the unforeseen and/or serious in nature barriers or problems that caused the lack of academic success.  Based on what you have shared with me, it sounds like the (recap what student stated was their reason for withdrawing).

Is that all accurate?

You should also include the date(s) this happened so the Appeals Board knows this was while you were in school.

The Appeals Board would also like to know how your situation prevented you from being able to focus on your studies. You should include as many details as possible about your situation at the time of the decrease in academic performance.

How would you answer that question?

Advise on any gaps in timeline or if the prospective student's answer is not clear, including their academic history and any specific courses or grades that could have led to their SAP Status.

Great, include that in your Appeal Letter as well.

Question 3 also asks if you have any additional documentation to support your circumstances or that can validate the date ranges (state date range beginning to end date range). This is not a requirement, but this documentation can help support your Appeal Letter.

Question 4 asks how this will no longer affect you from moving forward academically. How did you overcome these obstacles and what puts you in a better position to be able to focus on your studies again?

Advise if prospective student's answer is not clear.

Good, you will want to share that; the Appeals Board needs to know this will no longer be an obstacle for you.

Question 5 asks you to briefly state your reasoning for attending school and why you feel you should be reinstated. Tell them why getting this degree is important to you and share one or two things about yourself that will let them know you are serious about pursuing your studies again.

Once you have completed your letter, send it to me so we can review it together before sending it to the Appeals Board.

I can help guide you through this process to ensure you have included all of the necessary information in your appeal. Please take time when writing your appeal and follow the instructions provided.

Once submitted, you will receive an email with a determination from the Appeals Board and I will also call you to notify you of the decision.

#H:FSAID Steps

I’ll walk you through the next steps to get started on the FAFSA. Are you by your computer now?

#EX:

If the student does not have a Student Aid Account (FSA ID) ▼

You will need to create a Student Aid Account (FSA ID) in order to sign into your Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly referred to as the FAFSA. Have you created an account yet?

If not, let’s do that now. You can go to studentaid.gov to get started.

Walk the student through registering for their FSA ID. For additional assistance, use the FSA ID Guide.

#EXEND

#H:FAFSA

Today, I want to help you get started on your FAFSA, which is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and assist you with any questions you may have. As I mentioned before, this document must be completed to determine your eligibility for Federal Student Aid. This is a critical step to starting school if you plan to use federal funding. Once complete, our Financial Aid team can create a customized financial aid estimate for you.

We discussed some of the resources you will need to complete the FAFSA. Let’s recap the things you will need.

You will need the email with your FSA ID, so that you can access and sign the FAFSA electronically.

You will need your Social Security number.

You will need your current email address.

You will also need your federal income tax return, W-2’s, and any other records of income earned.

If you don’t have your tax information paperwork handy, the FAFSA contains an IRS Data Retrieval Tool, which may allow you to transfer your federal tax return information directly into your FAFSA. If you are not eligible to use the tool, you can just add your tax information into the FAFSA yourself. If you are a dependent student, then you will also need most of the above information for your parents as well.

If the student does not have their tax information, they can first attempt the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, then call the IRS at (800) 829-1040, or order online at irs.gov/Individuals/Get-Transcript.

You will also need our school code for the FAFSA, which is 014720.

Last, if you are not a U.S. citizen, you’ll also need your Alien Registration Number.

Do you have all of the resources I’ve just mentioned?

If the student says that they do not have one or more of these resources, help the student develop a plan to get or request the necessary resources before moving on.

Now that you have the resources you will need, let’s log into the FAFSA at studentaid.gov. I will help to guide you through getting started.

Once the student is logged onto the site, use the FAFSA Guide to help the student navigate the site and use the FAFSA FAQ to answer any questions.

#EX:

If this is the first time the student has completed a FAFSA ▼

Select Start a New FAFSA.

On the Login page select to “Enter your FSA ID”, then enter the email address and password you used to register for your FSA ID, and click next.

On the Get Started page, select the appropriate FAFSA year, and click next.

Now you will create your “Save Key”. This is a temporary password you can use to log back into the FAFSA before submitting it. If you are a dependent student, for Federal Student Aid purposes, you can share this temporary password with your parents, so that all parties can have access to the form. Please note that this is separate from your FSA ID. Your FSA ID should not be shared with anyone.

On the Introduction Page you will see frequently asked questions. You can use any of these links and you can also ask me any questions that you have about the application. Clicking next will take you to the next page.

Let me take a moment give and you a high-level overview of how to navigate through the rest of the FAFSA. At the top, you will see a Navigation Bar. These are the sections of the FAFSA you will need to complete, starting with Student Demographics, where you will enter your personal information.

The next section is School Selection. Here you can enter our school code, which is 014720. Entering this will allow your FAFSA information to be sent directly to AIU.

In the Dependency Status section, you will answer a series of questions that will determine your dependency status as it relates to federal funding. Your answers in this section will determine whether or not you need to fill out information in the Parent Demographics section.

If it is necessary for you to complete the Parent Demographics section, you will be asked specific information about your parents. You will need their assistance to complete this section.

The Financial Information section is where you can attempt to upload your tax information directly into the FAFSA using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. You will need your FSA ID to access the IRS Site from the FAFSA Site. You MUST complete the address information exactly how you filed the information on your taxes. For example; if you abbreviated “road” as “R-D” on your taxes, then it must be abbreviated the same way when populating the information on the IRS website.  Only when the information matches exactly, will the taxes link. If you are unable to upload your taxes directly, you can still enter your tax information manually in this section of the FAFSA.

In the Sign and Submit section, you will use your FSA ID to sign your FAFSA, and click “Sign”. Once signed, you can submit your FAFSA by clicking “Submit My FAFSA Now” to send your application to the Department of Education for processing.

Submitting the FAFSA will take you to the Confirmation Page and you will also receive an email stating that your FAFSA has been submitted. If you did not provide an email address in your application, print a copy of the confirmation page for your records.

Another important note as you begin working through each question, take a look at the Help and Hints box on the right side of your screen. This information will change with every question in the FAFSA and will provide details about how to answer based on your situation. It can be a very useful tool as you work on your FAFSA.

#EXEND

Do you have any questions I can answer for you right now?

Pause. Allow student to respond. Listen for questions or concerns.

Since you are logged in, please finish this now. Don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions, and we can make sure you get the assistance that you need.
